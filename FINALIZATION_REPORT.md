# REAL‑AGI Finalization Report

This report summarises the actions taken during the finalisation phase prior to deployment.  All fixes and improvements were performed without removing any existing features or altering validated logic.  Instead, quality, safety and robustness were enhanced.

## Repository Overview

- **Core modules**: located under `javu_agi/` and `evaluation/`.  Includes agents, tools, memory, and governance controllers.
- **Tests**: reside in `tests/` and `tests_smoke/`.
- **Configuration and deployment**: `Dockerfile`, `docker‑compose.yml`, `scripts/`, etc.

## Key Fixes

- **Exception Handling**: Replaced multiple bare `except:` statements with `except Exception:` or more specific exceptions (e.g. `json.JSONDecodeError`) to avoid masking unexpected errors and improve debuggability.
- **Identity State Initialisation**: Added a global `identity` variable and lazy loading in `identity_growth.py` to prevent `NameError` when evolving identity.  Documented the logic and ensured pruning logic remains intact.
- **Long‑Term Memory**: Consolidated unreachable returns and improved event summarisation.  Added descriptive docstrings and ensured file I/O errors are explicitly caught.
- **JSON Parsing**: Updated JSONL readers in dataset builders and adversarial suites to catch only decode errors, skipping malformed lines rather than suppressing all exceptions.
- **General Comments**: Added clarifying comments throughout to explain rationale behind safeguards and behaviours.

## Added Documentation

- Added **SECURITY.md**, **RUNBOOK.md**, **THREAT_MODEL.md**, **MODEL_CARD.md**, **SAFETY_EVAL_REPORT.md** and this **FINALIZATION_REPORT.md** to document security posture, operational procedures, threat analysis, model details, safety evaluations and finalisation actions.

## Next Steps

- Conduct dynamic testing (unit, integration, soak) and adversarial evaluation suites.  Update **SAFETY_EVAL_REPORT.md** with pass/fail statistics.
- Generate an SBOM and run dependency audits prior to release.
- Review this report and documentation with stakeholders to ensure readiness for production deployment.
