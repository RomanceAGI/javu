# AGI Evaluation Suite

This folder contains evaluation scripts to test key cognitive capacities of the AGI:

- `memory_recall_eval.py` - Tests if AGI can remember and retrieve information correctly.
- `goal_achievement_eval.py` - Tests if AGI can generate and execute goals properly.
- `reasoning_depth_eval.py` - Tests AGI's ability to handle multi-step reasoning for complex tasks.

Run each file manually using:
```bash
python eval/<file>.py

Future evaluations can be automated or tracked over time.
