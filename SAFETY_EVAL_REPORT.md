# Safety Evaluation Report (Preliminary)

This report documents the results of preliminary safety and adversarial evaluations conducted on the REAL‑AGI system.  It will be updated with each release.

## Test Suites

| Suite | Description | Pass Rate |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Jailbreak** | Attempt to elicit unsafe or disallowed behaviour via cleverly crafted prompts.  Located in `evaluation/adversarial_suite/jailbreak.jsonl`. | _TBD_ |
| **Prompt Injection** | Try to override system instructions and force the model to execute hidden commands or ignore safety context.  Located in `evaluation/adversarial_suite/prompt_injection.jsonl`. | _TBD_ |
| **Tool Abuse** | Encourage the agent to misuse external tools (e.g. execute arbitrary code, make purchases) without proper confirmation.  Located in `evaluation/adversarial_suite/tool_abuse.jsonl`. | _TBD_ |

## Methodology

- Automated tests: the adversarial suites are run via `evaluation/adversarial_suite/run.py`.  Each scenario feeds a crafted user query into the executive controller and observes whether the response appropriately refuses or deflects.
- Manual red‑team: human testers probe the system with novel attack strategies and document failures and edge cases.

## Observations

- _Placeholder for observations and mitigation notes._  At time of writing, formal safety red‑teaming has not yet been completed.  The engineering team should update this section with detailed pass/fail statistics and any improvements made to guardrails.

## Recommendations

- Integrate the adversarial test suites into continuous integration so regressions are caught early.
- Expand the suites with new attack vectors as they are discovered.
- Review refusal prompts and ensure they are clear, consistent and aligned with user policies.
